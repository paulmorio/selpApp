\section{Things to think about}
A reasonable report should contain the following:
\begin{itemize}
\item A justification for design choices, ranging from the language(s) you used to the architecture of your application
\item A description of your design
\item A description of your testing strategy
\item Any deficiencies in the functionality
\item Any deficiencies in the implementation/design
\item Make sure that I know of any non-obvious functionality. Generally its not that good to have non obvious functionality, but for example a security strategy or back up process is a good example.
\item Things you would do differently
\item Things you are proud of
\item \textbf{Give critical evaluation of your own code}
\item "A good report may make some broader point using your development as an example. For instance you may wish to advise for/against the use of a particular technology in a particular scenario."

\end{itemize}
